MINI TUTORIAL:
Each game instance (including
in the Editor) can either be 
server or client.

Determine on the uMMO prefab
whether to compile a server
or a client or select "Custom
Connector" for a default
testing interface. 

We are working on proper 
documentation. In the meantime
please refer to in-Editor 
documentation and our support
channels.
